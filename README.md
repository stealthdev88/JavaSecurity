Java Security
============
This repository contains several Java (web) application projects covering different security topics. Using Mozilla Firefox as browser is strongly recommended.

#FerrisWheelManager
Ferris Wheel Manager is a JEE 7 demo application containing security vulnerabilities like **SQL Injection** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. A datasource named **jdbc/fwm** is required, which must contain the tables/ data provided by SQL scripts in the [Resources](https://github.com/dschadow/JavaSecurity/tree/master/Resources/FerrisWheelManager) project. 
Valid usernames/passwords are **Marvin/wheel** (role **Manager**), **Zaphod/ferris** (role **User**).
This web application was tested with [Java Enterprise Edition 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee),  [GlassFish 4](https://glassfish.java.net) and [MySQL 5.6](http://dev.mysql.com).

#XSS
